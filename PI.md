## Platform Initialization (PI)

UEFI Platform Initialization (PI) describes the boot execution phases to encompass [[UEFI]] supported protocols and services. PI evolved from the original IntelÂ® Platform Innovation Firmware for EFI Specification. While UEFI primarily focuses on the interface between firmware and the operating system, PI focuses on interfaces between low-level firmware components.

The [PLATFORM INITIALIZATION WORK GROUP](http://uefi.org/workinggroups) (PIWG) of the UEFI Forum manages specification development.

> "The PEI and DXE specifications authored by Intel and other related specifications as mutually agreed to by a majority of the work group. Implementations of these specifications are intended to serve as firmware for initializing a computer system and are intended to be implementations below the interface layer presented by the UEFI Specification. Implementations of PEI and DXE would not be required for UEFI compliance." - http://uefi.org/workinggroups
