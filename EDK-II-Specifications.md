\] - This document describes the EDK II Build Architecture. This specification was designed to support new build requirements for building EDK II modules and EDK components within the EDK II build infrastructure as well as to generate binary firmware images and Unified Extensible Firmware Image (UEFI) applications.

## DEC
Declaration file format-\[
[HTML   ](https://www.gitbook.com/read/book/edk2-docs/edk-ii-dec-specification),

[GitHub ](https://github.com/tianocore-docs/edk2-DecSpecification)
\] - This document describes the EDK II Declaration (DEC) file format. This format was designed to support building packaging and distribution of EDK II modules, as well as for building platforms and modules using the EDK II build infrastructure. EDK II declaration files may be created during installation of a distribution that follows the UEFI Platform Initialization Distribution Package Specification. They may also be created manually. The EDK II Build Infrastructure supports generation of UEFI 2.5 and PI 1.4 (Unified EFI, Inc.) compliant binary images.

In order to use EDK II Modules or the EDK II Build Tools, an EDK II DSC and FDF file must be used. EDK II tools use INI style text based files to describe components, platforms and firmware volumes. While similar to EDK DSC files, the EDK II DSC file format is different, and new utilities have been provided to process these files. The EDK II Build Infrastructure supports creation of binary images that comply with Unified EFI (UEFI) 2.5 and UEFI Platform Infrastructure (PI) 1.4 specifications.

\] - The EDK II C Coding Standards Specification establishes a set of rules intended not as
a constraint, but as an enabling philosophy which will:
  * Establish uniformity of style.
  * Set minimum information content requirements.
  * Allow all programmers to easily understand the code.
  * Facilitate support tasks by establishing uniform conventions.
  * Ease documentation efforts by embedding the design documentation in the code.
  * Reduce customer and new employee learning curves by providing accurate code documentation and uniform style.

  These rules apply to all code developed.
