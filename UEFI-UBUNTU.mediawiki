== Ubuntu Versions Supporting UEFI ==

Ubuntu Linux supports x64 [[UEFI]] for 64-bit builds, starting with 10.10. We recommend using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS or higher with x64 UEFI.

No IA32 UEFI support is available in Ubuntu, but is supported in [[Debian Linux|UEFI Debian]] starting with the Jessie release.

== Support for UEFI Secure Boot ==

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS or higher supports [[UEFI Secure Boot|Secure Boot]], with an OS shim loader signed by the [[UEFI CA]]. This means that a system properly configured for UEFI Secure Boot can load Ubuntu Linux without enabling legacy BIOS support, or disabling Secure Boot in the firmware setup menus.
