    -   Ia16/Real16ToFlat32.asm: Mode Switch: Real =&gt; 32-bit Flat
    -   Ia32/SearchForBfvBase.asm: Locates the Boot FirmwareVolume (BFV)
    -   Ia32/SearchForSecEntry.asm: Locates the SEC Core with BFV
    -   Ia32/Flat32ToFlat64.asm: If 64-bit PEI, then Mode Switch: 32-bit Flat to 64-bit Long
-   SEC Core: OvmfPkg/Sec
    -   OvmfPkg/Sec/SecMain.c: Finds PEI Core

Pre-EFI Initialization

-   PEI Core: MdeModulePkg/Core/Pei
    -   Various PEI drivers now run
-   DXE IPL (Loader for the DXE Core)
    -   Finds DXE Core
    -   If PEI is 32-bit and DXE is 64-bit, then Mode Switch: 32-bit Flat to 64-bit Long
    -   Jumps to DXE Core

DXE
===

Driver Execution Environment

Boot Device Selection

-   BDS: IntelFrameworkModulePkg/Universal/BdsDxe + IntelFrameworkModulePkg/Library/GenericBdsLib
    -   OvmfPkg/Library/PlatformBdsLib guides BDS in a platform specific manner
-   BDS figures out what to boot, and starts devices to enable the boot
    -   BDS may be able to load the EFI shell if it is present in the system firmware file system
